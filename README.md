# Cookie-Exploit
Exploit for websites cookies and access to read files from the target

## How ?
It works in such a way that it tests the websites that use the load directory in base64 cookies and the desired directories can be read.

## Way to Hack !

* Another injection method of these websites is to read the logs. For example, if the target web server was ngnix, you can see the user-agent by reading the ngnix log file located in /var/log/ngnix/access.log. You may say, what is the use of user-agent? You can use burp suit or a programming language to put malicious php code instead of user-agent and enter the web server logs. Congratulations, the site was hacked.

### The main reason for this vulnerability !
